# Token-Level Multi-Class Classification for POS Tagging using Deep Learning

This project focuses on token-level multi-class classification for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using deep learning models. Four different architectures were implemented and evaluated: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). The models were trained and tested on a pre-split POS tagging dataset, and evaluated using accuracy, F1-score (macro and weighted), confusion matrix, and classification report.
